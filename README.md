- [ ] Make application look prettier and use Styled Components üíÖ
- [ ] Modularize code more into more composable files (JS and CSS)
- [ ] Add server-side rendering to improve SEO and have better performance
- [ ] Create proper authorization flow that doesn‚Äôt require user providing their API Key in plain text

- [ ] Only display repositories on load and then load issues once a repository is selected
- [ ] Improve error handling when provided with an invalid GitHub API key or rate-limited

- [ ] Allow option in UI to filter by assignee
- [ ] Allow option in UI to assign a user to an issue

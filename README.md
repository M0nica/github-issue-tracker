## Future Functionality to Implement

- [ ] Increase test coverage
  - [ ] i.e., mock fetch
- [ ] Make application look prettier üíÖ
- [ ] Modularize code more into more composable files
- [ ] Add server-side rendering to improve SEO and have better performance
- [ ] Create proper authorization flow that doesn‚Äôt require user providing their API Key in plain text

- [ ] Improve error handling when provided with an invalid GitHub API key
